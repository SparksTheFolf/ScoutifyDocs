Welcome to Scoutify's Documentation and Public Whitepaper!
===================================

**Scoutify** (/Scout'ify/) is a closed source machine learning FRC (First Robotics Competition) api wrapper that accuratly computes match information based on custom sources and custom algorithms.

In essence, It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_

and offers a somewhat *simple* (cough cough, open source) and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under HEAVY active development. So expect changes to the API and the documentation.

Scoutify's Documentation and Public Whitepaper
===================================

**Scoutify** (/Scout'ify/) is a closed source machine learning model for FRC (First Robotics Competition) api wrapper that accuratly computes match information based on custom sources and custom wrapper algorithms.

In essence, It pulls data from:

1. `FRC Events API <https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/services/api>`_
2. `The Blue Alliance <https://TheBlueAlliance.com>`_
3. Custom Oracle/Firebase Database Wrapper for robot/match specfic information
4. `Statbotics <https://statbotics.io>`_

and offers a somewhat *simple* (cough cough, closed source) and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under HEAVY active development. So expect changes to the API and the documentation.
